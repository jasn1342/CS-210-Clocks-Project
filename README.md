# Clocks

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
#-This project involved creating two digital clocks, one 12-hour and the other 24-hour, for a website that involved allowing the user to add an hour, minute, or second to the current time. The assignment was meant as an interview project given by a potential employer. 

#What did you do particularly well?
#-I believe that I did well in organizing my code and using in-line comments to let my team know where to find each section of code. I was also able to make the clock show the current time, which I felt good about once I fugured out how to do it. My origian lplan was to just start the clock at 12:00 and 24:00 and work from there.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
#- With this having been the first coding project in C++ that I had done, I had not considered using a header file. If I were to do this project again, I would utlize a header and clocks.cpp to build out my functions and call them from a main.cpp file.

#Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
#- I definitely found this code to be challenging, more so due to my inexperience with C++ and coding in general. I utlized workshops and tutors to help get me through roadblocks that I had difficulty hurdling. If I was unable to find an answer to my questions through google and other online resources, I would use SNHU's Academic Support Center to find tutors that could walk me through it. I noticed that every tutur I used would do things slightly differently, so that helped me realize that there isn't always one way to do something.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
#- Learning how to properly organize my code to make it more readable was something that I picked up from this project. Keeping things organized also made it much easier to move code around if needed. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
#- I made this program maintanable, readable, and adaptable by keeping everything organized in sections and using in-line comments were I felt it would be necessary. I didin't want to overload the program with comments, especially in sections where it may have been obvious to know what I was trying to do, such as with menus. If another developer wanted to needed to make changes to my conde and it's structure, they would be able to do it relatively easily.
